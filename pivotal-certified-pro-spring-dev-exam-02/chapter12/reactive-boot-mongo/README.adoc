You need MongoDB installed locally to run the MongoReactiveApplication.java class.

=== Install MongoDB

The first step is to install it on your system. Instructions to install on any operating system can be found on their
official site here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/.

The next step is to start MongoDB. On every operating system there is an executable that can do this, but
you first need to create a directory where the database files will be saved. In the next case the directory is
`/home/temp/reactive-db/`.

The database service will be started on the 27017 port.
```
iuliana.cosmina@home - $ ./mongod --dbpath /home/temp/reactive-db/
CONTROL (initandlisten) MongoDB starting : pid=89126 port=27017
dbpath=/Users/iuliana.cosmina/temp/reactive-db/ 64-bit host=home
CONTROL (initandlisten) db version v4.0.10
NETWORK (initandlisten) waiting for connections on port 27017
```

Open the mongo shell and test what database is used by executing the `db` command. The returned result should
be `test`.
```
iuliana.cosmina@home - $ mongo
MongoDB shell version v4.0.10
