If you want to use an Oracle database, for this exercise the recommendation is to use a local Docker instance.

=== Database

Install Docker (https://www.docker.com/).

Then install this container: https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition.
Follow instructions on the container page and test your database using Oracle SQL Developer.
Usually you might need to go through the following steps:

- create an account
- log in
- search for Oracle
- the first result should be the container linked above
- click on the "Proceed to Checkout" button
- check all the boxes required in the Developer Tier view

- then open a terminal and execute:
```
$ docker pull store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1
$ docker login
$ docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 -it --name local-oracle store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1
```
where `local-oracle` is the name of the container. You can now see it with Kitematic, and it will take a little to fully start.

- You can test the database being up by executing `docker ps -a`. You should see something similar to:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS                                              NAMES
d9fe67c59e67        store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1   "/bin/sh -c '/bin/baâ€¦"   7 minutes ago       Up 7 minutes (healthy)        0.0.0.0:1521->1521/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5500->5500/tcp     local-oracle
```
- Once the Oracle Database is up you can set up a connection in SQL developer. Use the following:
```
user: sys
password: Oradoc_db1
Connection Type: Basic
Role: SYSDBA
Hostname: localhost
Port: 1521
SID: ORCLDCB
```

Open a terminal
View containers:
----
docker container ls
----
or
----
docker ps
----

You can also install Kitematic to view and manage your containers.
If you ever shutdown the database or restart your computer the container mustbe started before using it. You can do that from Kitematic,
 but if that fails, you can also try teh following command:
 ---
 docker start local-oracle
 ---

==== SQL script needed to create the user and schema:

Using the `sys` connection declared previously, execute the following.
----
alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;

CREATE USER prod IDENTIFIED BY prod;
GRANT CONNECT TO prod;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO prod;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO prod;
GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO prod;
----
You can create a SQL Developer connection using the `prod` user, just remember to use `Role: default`
