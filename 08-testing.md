### What type of tests typically use Spring?

Thus Spring is not commonly used in unit tests.

**Integration testing** is testing of several modules of software when they are combined together and tested as a whole. In such tests the relationships between the components is significant. When using the Spring framework for dependency injection, the configuration files or classes used by the dependency injection framework also need to be correct and should therefore be tested. 

Thus integration tests should use Spring dependency injection.
