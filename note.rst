What is Dependency Injection?
-----------------------------

Dependency injection means giving an object its instance variables.

Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself.
It's a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out.

Inversion of control is a common characteristic of frameworks
that facilitate injection of dependencies. And the basic idea of the dependency injection
pattern is to have a separate object that injects dependencies with the required behavior,
based on an interface contract.


Advantage of Dependency Injection
---------------------------------

* Increases cohesion

* Decreases coupling between classes and their dependencies

* Reduces boilerplate Code

* Makes program more reusable, testable and maintainable

* Increases flexibility (by interfaces)
